The following python notebooks are part of this repository:

1. CLIP_ViT-L14 notebook captures the results of CLIP large pre-trained model on personality trait recognition dataset.
2. CLIP_ViT-B16 notebooks captures the results of CLIP base model on personality trait recognition dataset.
3. CLIP_finetuning_models notebook would have various convolutional and sequential models used to fine-tune the CLIP-generated image embeddings on personality trait recognition dataset.
4. video_extraction.py file has the code to load input videos and extract frames for experiments.
